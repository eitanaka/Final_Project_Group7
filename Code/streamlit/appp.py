st.write("In the dynamic realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), the advent of question-answering (QA) systems marks a significant stride in our ability to interact with and process digital information. "
         "This project is dedicated to developing a reading comprehension-based QA system inspired by the comprehensive insights in Speech and Language Processing by Daniel Jurafsky & James H. Martin (2023). "
         "We aim to create a system that can interpret and respond to questions posed in natural language, drawing answers from provided text passages.")

st.write("SQuAD 2.0 stands as an innovative dataset strategically crafted to propel advancements in the domain of machine reading comprehensionâ€”an integral facet of natural language understanding. "
         "Distinguished from its predecessor, SQuAD 1.1, this dataset introduces a notable enhancement: the integration of 53,775 unanswerable questions meticulously generated by crowdworkers. "
         "These questions leverage the same passages employed in SQuAD 1.1 but are intentionally formulated to maintain relevance to the content while introducing plausible yet incorrect answers. "
         "This deliberate shift from the preceding version, which solely featured answerable questions with correct responses within the provided text, signifies a significant evolution. "
         "Below, we present two illustrative examples of this distinctive design.")
